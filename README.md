homebrew-postgis-for-93
==============

Custom brew for using postgis with the brew versions postgresql93.

Installation
------------

It's pretty easy, you just need homebrew version `0.9` or greater and some
sauce:

    brew tap johnschultz/homebrew-postgis-for-93
    brew install postgis

If the formula conflicts with one in `mxcl/master`, you can explicitly target this formula with:

    brew install johnschultz/postgis-for-93/postgis  # yes without the 'homebrew-'

Cheers.
